====================

The Simulity Http Client project provides an abstraction level to the Apache HttpClient project and has been provided to allow for easier testing of third party applications developed by Simulity. The project is tested by simulating requests to a Node JS application server; therefore, to run the testing action please ensure that NodeJS is installed.
